                          Simple backup manager to check and compare RADI-0
                          backups. There are a couple of usages for this
                          application:
                          
                          1. Index files into an H2 DB
                          2. Compare two directories and report differences
                          3. Validate directory against the H2 DB and report
                             differences
                          4. Export H2 DB as an .xlsx file
                          
                          Most common use-case is to check if files on one external
                          drive match files on the other by comparing them. This
                          compares all CRC32 file hashes and reports differences.
